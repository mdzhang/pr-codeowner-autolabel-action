Add labels to GitHub PRs based on the contents of [`CODEOWNERS`](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners)

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  permissions:
    contents: read
    pull-requests: write
  steps:
    - name: Checkout
      id: checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: PR Codeowner Autolabel
      id: pr-codeowner-autolabel
      uses: mdzhang/pr-codeowner-autolabel-action
      with:
        # default is CODEOWNERS
        file-path: .github/CODEOWNERS
        repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        labels-to-owners: |
          {
            "frontend": "@myteam/@frontend-guild"
          }
```

Note that dependabot PRs will get labeled by default as well! If not desired add the following to the workflow:

```yaml
if: ${{ github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]' }}
```
