## Setup

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need to have a reasonably modern version of
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) handy (20.x or later should work!). If you are
> using a version manager like [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or
> [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), this template has a `.node-version`
> file at the root of the repository that will be used to automatically switch
> to the correct version when you `cd` into the repository. Additionally, this
> `.node-version` file is used by GitHub Actions in any `actions/setup-node`
> actions.

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. :building_construction: Package the TypeScript for distribution

   ```bash
   npm run bundle
   ```

1. :white_check_mark: Run the tests

   ```bash
   $ npm test

   PASS  ./index.test.js
     ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
     ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
     ✓ test runs (95ms)

   ...
   ```

## Development

1. Create a new branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b releases/v1
   ```

1. Replace the contents of `src/` with your action code
1. Add tests to `__tests__/` for your source code
1. Format, test, and build the action

   ```bash
   npm run all
   ```

   > [!WARNING]
   >
   > This step is important! It will run [`ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc)
   > to build the final JavaScript action code with all dependencies included.
   > If you do not run this step, your action will not work correctly when it is
   > used in a workflow. This step also includes the `--license` option for
   > `ncc`, which will create a license file for all of the production node
   > modules used in your project.

1. Commit your changes

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "My first action is ready!"
   ```

1. Push them to your repository

   ```bash
   git push -u origin releases/v1
   ```

1. Create a pull request and get feedback on your action
1. Merge the pull request into the `main` branch
1. The [`test-action`](./github/workflows/ci.yml) check in CI will do a basic check on the action

## Publishing a new release

This project includes a helper script (`./script/release`) designed to streamline the process of
tagging and pushing new releases for GitHub Actions.

It performs the following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent release tag by looking at the local data available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the latest release tag
   and provides a regular expression to validate the format of the new tag.
1. **Tagging the new release:** Once a valid new tag is entered, the script tags
   the new release.
1. **Pushing the new tag to the remote:** Finally, the script pushes the new tag
   to the remote repository. From here, you will need to create a new release in
   GitHub and users can easily reference the new tag in their workflows.
